**"Playing in the physical and converting it to the digital"**

2. [**Project Development**](#2-Project-development)
3. [**Final Product**](#3-Rethink-and-reconnect)

## #1 Project Alignment

We started sharing our interests and what fields we wanted to investigate to be able to implement them to our interventions. This three circles show the intersection between our main interests.

We decided to continue the [first Challenge](https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco) and develop iterations to improve it and make it a more automated process.

First Iteration

As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, personalisation of a product… We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those.


## #2 Project Development

Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board which provides the user to make their own unique design.

Tile-Deco is a concept of grid that made of acrylic and magnets and has geometric pieces which can be located on and stick by magnets to the grid in order to form various tile decorations.

**Design Process**
1. Grid board
2. Geometric pieces
3. Pattern design
4. Photo digitalisation (vector)
5. Vinyl cutting
6. Stencil
7. Tile production
8. Building pattern

Tile Deco

## As a group we decided to develop an interface for our tile-deco and pixel-cube  projects ( maybe a website) in order to eliminate the use of grasshopper apps  and firefly plugin and make the process more accessible and easier if possible. Briefly, our main goal is to support the makers and crafts, and encourage them to use digital fabrication tools.

We agreed on using OPENCV shape detector. But, in order to use OPENCV we need PHYTON, ANACONDA and VISUAL STUDIO too. Firstly, we set the anaconda and phyton and opencv. Then we found a code for shape recognition-detection especially for “circle” from an image. We tested that through the anaconda and of course code had some problems and we asked from CHATGPT to fix the code. More or less the code works through the image but we needed to calibrate the parameters in order to get more accurate results. 

During the second day we continued to work on shape detection code. After detecting the circles on the still images we tried to configure the code for squares, rectangle, triangle, semi/quarter circles. We used edge detection and tried to convert them to defined geometric shapes, but we had problems with some undefined ones as lemon shape or croissant shape. So, in order to solve this we worked on polygon contouring but it did not ended up with smooth curves. Then, Pietro joined to support us for using phyton libraries. 

After some discussions, we decided to use QR code detection in opencv libraries for assigned geometric shapes as we did with the fiducials on Grasshopper-firefly application model during the Challenge-No2 and we wanted to combine that with Three JS Interactive Voxel Painter project as a grid base. We spent some hours on this approach. Finally, we decided that would take months to finalize the work. 

We went back to the basic idea to detect the edges of the each geometric shapes on the grid that we designed and decided to eliminate the shades and work on lighting in order to get the best results with this basic and simple method which can be done on OpenCv and Python.
